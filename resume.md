##Summary  
Started perusing vocal performance at Texas Christian University on scholarship before switching majors to computer science. Moved up to Utah for various reasons and am continuing my education. I've had previous work experience in a leadership position. I've been working with and using computers daily for as long as I can remember. I'm motivated, willing, and have been told I'm a very fast learner.
